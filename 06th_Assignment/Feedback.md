Yes, I can see your revision, but the argument "Once we choose a origin and a basis of the Euclidean space, all 2^n pointsâ€™ coordinates are fixed" is far from obvious and deserves a detailed proof. Once possible way is to use induction on the levels, i.e., try to prove when the vertices on the i-th level are fixed, then the vertices on the (i+1)-th level must also be fixed.
