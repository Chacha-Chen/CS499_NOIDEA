\section{Partial Orderings}



\subsection{Equivalence Relations as a Partial Ordering}

An equivalence relation $R \subseteq V \times V$ is basically the same as a partition
of $V$. A {\em partition} of $V$ is a set $\{V_1,\dots,V_k\}$ where
(1) $V_1 \cup \dots \cup V_k = V$ and (2) the $V_i$ are pairwise disjoint,
i.e., $V_i \cap V_j  = \emptyset$ for $1 \leq i < j \leq k$. For example,
$\{ \{1\}, \{2,3\}, \{4\} \}$ is a partition of $\{1,2,3,4\}$ but
$\{ \{1\}, \{2,3\}, \{1,4\}\}$ is not.



\begin{exercise}
  Let $E_4$ be the set of all equivalence relations on $\{1,2,3,4\}$. Note that
  $E_4$ is ordered by set inclusion, i.e.,
  \begin{align*}
     (E_4, \{ (R_1,R_2) \in E_4 \times E_4 \ | \ R_1 \subseteq R_2 \} )
  \end{align*}
  is a partial ordering.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Draw the Hasse diagram of this partial ordering in a  nice way.

    \end{figure}

    \item What is the size of the largest chain?

    \textbf{solution:}the size of the largest chain is 4.

    \item What is the size of the largest antichain?

    \textbf{solution:}the size of the largest antichain is 6.
  \end{enumerate}
  \end{exercise}


\subsection{Chains and Antichains}

Define the partially ordered set $(\nn, \leq)$ as follows:
$x \leq y$ if $x_i \leq y_i$ for all $1 \leq i \leq n$. For example,
$(2,5,4) \leq (2,6,6)$ but $(2,5,4) \not \leq (3,1,1)$.

\begin{exercise}
  Consider the infinite partially ordered set $(\nn, \leq)$.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    Which elements are minimal? Which are maximal?

    \textbf{solution:} (0,0,...,0)is the minimal. There is no maximal element.

  \item Is there a minimum? A maximum?

  \textbf{solution:} (0,0,...,0)is the minimum. There is no maximum element.

  \item Does it have an infinite chain?

  \textbf{solution:} Yes. If it does not have an infinite chain, it will have the maximum element which we assume it$ (a_1,a_2,...,a_n)$. Then we have the element$ (a_1+1,a_2+1,...,a_n+1)$, which is obviously greater than $ (a_1,a_2,...,a_n)$. Thus, it have an infinite chain.

  \item Does it have arbitrarily large antichains? That is, can you find an
  antichain $A$ of size $|A| = k$ for every $k \in \N$?

  \textbf{solution:} Yes.For every  $k \in \N$, there is an antichain like$(1,0,\cdots,0)$,\\$ (0,1,\cdots,0)$,$\cdots$,$(0,0,\cdots,1)$, which is an antichain.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exerciseD}
  Does every infinite subset $S \subseteq \nn$ contain
  an infinite chain?
\end{exerciseD}
\textbf{solution:}  


\begin{exercise}
  Show that $(\nn,\leq)$ has no infinite antichain. \textbf{Hint.} Use
  the previous exercise.
\end{exercise}



Consider the induced ordering on $\{0,1\}^n$. That is, for $x,y\in \{0,1\}^n$
we have $x \leq y$ if $x_i \leq y_i$ for every coordinate $i \in [n]$.

\begin{exercise}
 Draw the Hasse diagrams of $(\{0,1\}^n, \leq)$ for $n=2,3$.
\end{exercise}


  \begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{pic2.png}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.2]{pic3.png}
    \caption{the Hasse diagrams of $(\{0,1\}^n, \leq)$ for $n=2,3$}
    \end{figure}

\begin{exercise}
  Determine the maximum, minimum, maximal, and minimal elements of
  $\{0,1\}^n$.
\end{exercise}

\textbf{solution:} The maximum and maximal element are both $11...1$(it has n many 1's). The minimum and minimal element are both $00...0$(it has n many 0's).

\begin{exercise}
  What is the longest chain of $\{0,1\}^n$?
\end{exercise}

\textbf{solution:} The longest chain of  $\{0,1\}^n$ is $ 00...0, 00...1,00...11,..., 11...1$. The length of the chain is $n+1$.

\begin{exerciseDD}
  What is the largest antichain of $\{0,1\}^n$?
\end{exerciseDD}

\textbf{solution:} $L_i={x\in{0,1}^n|x has i many 1's}$ ,obviously $|L_i|=(_i^n)$ and$ L_i$is an antichain. When $i=[{n\over 2}]$,$|L_i|=(_i^n)$has the largest value, let's name it A. If A is not the largest antichain, it must contain another element B below the midlevel. Since every B in the$ i_{th} $level can compare with an element in the $i+1_{th}$ level, we can move B upwards. If we continue moving B upwards B can reach the midlevel, thus this is not an antichain.



\subsection{Infinite Sets}

In the lecture (and the lecture notes) we have showed that $\N \times \N \cong \N$, i.e.,
there is a bijection $f: \N \times \N \rightarrow \N$. From this, and by induction, it follows
quite easily that $\N^k \cong \N$ for every $k$.

\begin{exercise}
   Consider $\N^*$, the set of all finite sequences of natural numbers, that is,
   $\N^* = \{\epsilon\} \cup \N \cup \N^2 \cup \N^3 \cup \dots$. Here,
   $\epsilon$ is the empty sequence. Show that $\N \cong \N^*$ by defining
   a bijection $\N \rightarrow \N^*$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
   Show that $R \cong R \times R$. \textbf{Hint:} Use the fact that
   $R \cong \{0,1\}^{\N}$ and thus show that $\{0,1\}^{\N} \cong \{0,1\}^{\N} \times \{0,1\}^{\N}$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  Consider $\R^{\N}$, the set of all infinite sequences $(r_1, r_2, r_3,\dots)$ of real numbers.
  Show that $\R \cong \R^{\N}$. \textbf{Hint:} Again, use the fact that $\R \cong \{0,1\}^{\N}$.
\end{exercise}

Next, let us view $\{0,1\}^{\N}$ as a partial ordering: given two elements $\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b} \in \{0,1\}^{\N}$,
that is, sequences $\mathbf{a} = (a_1,a_2,\dots)$ and $\mathbf{b} = (b_1,b_2,\dots)$, we define
$\mathbf{a} \leq \mathbf{b}$ if $a_i \leq b_i$ for all $i \in \N$. Clearly,
$(0,0,\dots)$ is the minimum element in this ordering and $(1,1,\dots)$ the maximum.\\

\begin{exercise}
   Give a countably infinite chain in $\{0,1\}^{\N}$. Remember that a set $A$ is countably infinite
   if $A \cong \N$.
\end{exercise}

   Find a countably infinite antichain in $\{0,1\}^{\N}$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
   Find an uncountable antichain in $\{0,1\}^{\N}$. That is, an antichain $A$ with $A \cong \R$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exerciseDD}
   Find an uncountable chain in $\{0,1\}^{\N}$. That is, an antichain $A$ with $A \cong \R$.
