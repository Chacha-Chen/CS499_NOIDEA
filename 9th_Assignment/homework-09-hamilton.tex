\subsection{Regular Orientations of a Regular Graph}

We call a graph {\em $d$-regular} if every vertex has degree $d$. 
A directed graph is $(d,d)$-regular if every vertex has $d$ incoming and $d$
outgoing edges.

\begin{exercise}
   Show that in every $4$-regular graph, you can orient the edges such that every vertex
   has two incoming and two outgoing edges, i.e., such that the resulting
   digraph is $(2,2)$-regular. See the picture below for an illustration.
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Hamilton Cycles and Ore's Theorem}

Consider $K_n$, the complete graph on $n$ vertices. For $n \geq 3$, this obviously has a Hamilton cycle.
How many edges do you have to delete from $K_n$ to destroy all Hamilton cycles? That is, what is the 
smallest set $S$ such that $\left( V, {V \choose 2} \setminus S\right)$ has no Hamilton cycle? Let $s_n$ denote
the size of this set (this depends on $n$, thus the notation $s_n$). For example, $s_2 = 0$ since $K_2$
has no Hamilton path to begin with; $s_3 = 1$ since removing one edge from $K_3$ results in a graph without
a Hamilton cycle.

\begin{exercise}
 Find a closed formula for $s_n$ and prove it! \textbf{Hint.} One part will be easy. For the other part,
 use Ore's Theorem.
\end{exercise}

A {\em tournament} is a directed graph in which, for each pair $u,v \in V$, exactly one of the 
directed edges $(u,v)$ and $(v,u)$ is in the graph. Imagine a sports tournament in which every participant
plays against every other exactly once. Draw an arc from $u$ to $v$ if $u$ beat $v$ in this tournament.

\end{center}

\begin{exercise}
   Show that every tournament has a {\em directed Hamilton path}, i.e., a sequence
   $u_1,u_2,\dots,u_n$ such that $(u_i, u_{i+1}) \in E$ for all $i = 1,\dots, n-1$. See the picture below.

  You probably won't be able to use the proof of Ore's Theorem directly, but you can use the proof idea.
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Isomorphism Classes of Trees}

In the lecture (and in the videos) we have seen that the number of trees on 
vertex set $V = \{1,2,\dots,n\}$ is $n^{n-2}$. This however ignores isomorphisms.
For example, there are $3^{3-2} = 3$ trees on vertex set $\{1,2,3\}$, but all those 
trees look alike (are isomorphic). On $\{1,2,3,4\}$, there are 16 trees, but 
there are only two isomorphism classes: the path and the star. For five vertices, there are 125 trees
but only three isomorphism classes: the path, the star, and the ``T-shape'' (see video on
counting the number of trees). For $n=6$ we get the path, the Y-shape, the Euro symbol, the Star Wars fighter, the Scandinavian cross, and the star, so six isomorphism classes (but a total of 1296 trees).

\begin{exercise}
  List of isomorphism classes on seven vertices. That is, draw trees $T_1,\dots,T_m$ on seven vertices such that 
  no two of them are isomorphic but every tree on seven vertices is isomorphic to one of them. 
  How many do you get?
\end{exercise}



\begin{tabular}{r|c|c|c|c|c|c|c}
$n$ & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 \\ \hline
number of isomorphism classes & 
          1 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 6 & ? 
\end{tabular}
\vspace{5mm}

Alright, so let's denote by $t_n$ the number of isomorphism classes of trees on $n$ vertices.
That is, $t_n$ is the largest number $m$ such that we can find trees $T_1,\dots,T_m$ on 
$n$ vertices such that no two of them are isomorphic. We would like to have an exact and
 explicit formula for $t_n$, but that is probably too much to ask for.
Instead, let us try to understand $t_n$ approximately and asymptotically.

\begin{exercise}
  Show that $t_n \leq 4^n$. Hint: Consider the video on the isomorphism problem on trees.
  It defines a way to encode a tree as a $0/1$-sequence.
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
  Show that $t_n \geq \frac{e^n}{\poly(n)}$, where $\poly(n)$ is some polynomial in $n$.
  Hint: There are $n^{n-2}$ trees on $V = [n]$. We group them together in ``buckets''
  of isomorphic trees. How large can a bucket be? Answer this and then use Stirling's approximation
  for $n!$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exerciseDD}
   Try to improve those bounds. That is, find some $a < 4$ such that $t_n \in O(a^n)$ or 
   some $b > e$ such that $t_n \in \Omega(b^n)$. Any improvement will be kind of interesting.
   Aim for simple proofs!
\end{exerciseDD}

\textbf{Remark.} The ``true'' rate of growth is known by a result of George P\'olya but apparently 
it is quite difficult (I write ``apparently'' because I have never studied this work).
