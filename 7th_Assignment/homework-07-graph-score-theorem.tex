\begin{exercise}
  Describe, in simple sentences with a minimum of mathematical formalism, (1) the score
  of a graph, (2) what the graph score theorem is, (3) the idea of the 
  graph score algorithm, (4) where the difficult part of its proof is.
  Imagine you have a friend who does not take this class, and think about how to answer
  the above questions to them.
\end{exercise} 



\subsection{Alternative Graphs}

Now we will look at different notions of graphs. As defined in class and in the video
lectures, a graph is a pair $G = (V,E)$ where $V$ is a (usually finite) set, called the {\em vertices},
and $E \subseteq {V \choose 2}$, called the set of {\em edges}.

\paragraph{Multigraphs.} 
A {\em multigraph} is like a graph, but you can have several parallel edges between
two vertices. You cannot, however, have self-loops. That is, there cannot
be an edge from $u$ to $u$ itself. This is an example of a multigraph:

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{figures/multigraph-score.pdf}
\end{center}

We can define degree and score for multigraphs, too. For example, this multigraph
has score $(4,4,2)$. Obviously no graph
can have this score.



\begin{exercise}
  State a score theorem for multigraphs. That is, something like
  \begin{theorem}[Multigraph Score Theorem]
     Let $(a_1,\dots,a_n) \in \N_0^n$. There is a multigraph
     with this score if and only if \texttt{\textup{<fill in some simple criterion here>}}.
  \end{theorem}
  
  
  \textbf{Remark.} This is actually
  simpler than for graphs.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  Prove your theorem.
\end{exercise}


\newcommand{\wdeg}{\textnormal{wdeg}}

\paragraph{Weighted graphs.} A weighted graph is a graph in which every edge $e$ has a non-negative weight $w_e$.
In such a graph the {\em weighted degree} of a vertex $u$ is $\wdeg(u) = \sum_{ \{u,v\} \in E} w_{\{u,v\}}$.

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{figures/weighted-graph-score.pdf}
\end{center}

This is an example of a weighted graph, which has score $(3,2,2)$. Obviously no graph
and no multigraph can have this score.

\begin{exercise}
  State a score theorem for weighted graphs. That is, state something like
  \begin{theorem}[Weighted Graph Score Theorem]
     Let $(a_1,\dots,a_n) \in \R_0^n$. There is a weighted graph
     with this score if and only if \texttt{\textup{<fill in some simple criterion here>}}.
  \end{theorem}
  \textbf{Remark.} This 
  is actually even simpler.
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
  Prove your theorem.
\end{exercise}

\paragraph{Allowing negative edge weights.} Suppose now we allow negative edge weights, like here:
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{figures/arbitrary-weighted-graph-score.pdf}
\end{center}
This ``graph with real edge weights'' has score $(2,0,0)$. This score is impossible for
graphs, multigraphs, and weighted graphs with non-negative edge weights.


\begin{exercise}
  State a score theorem for weighted graphs when we allow
  negative edge weights. That is, state a theorem like
  \begin{theorem}[Score Theorem for Graphs with Real Edge Weights]
     Let $(a_1,\dots,a_n) \in \R^n$. There is a  graph with real edge weights
     with this score if and only if \texttt{\textup{<fill in some simple criterion here>}}.
  \end{theorem}  
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Prove your theorem.
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
   For each student ID $(a_1,\dots,a_n)$ in your group, check whether 
   this is (1) a graph score, (2) a multigraph score, (3) a weighted graph score, or
   (4) the score of a graph with real edge weights.
   
   Whenever the answer is {\em yes}, show the graph, when it is {\em no}, 
   give a short argument why. 
\end{exercise}

\paragraph{Example Solution.} My work ID is 50411. 
This is a weighted graph score, as shown by this picture:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/graph-50411.pdf}
\end{center}
This settles (3). It is not a multigraph score, because BLABLABLA. I won't give more details, as it might
give too many hints about Exercise 7.2. Alright, this settles (2). Note that I do {\em not} need to answer 
(4), as this is already answered by (3). Neither do I need to answer (1), as a ``no'' for (2) implies
a ``no'' for (1).
