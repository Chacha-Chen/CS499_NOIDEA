\subsection{Matchings}


Consider the Hamming cube $\{0,1\}^n$. We can view it as a graph $H_n$,
where the vertex set is $\{0,1\}^n$ and two vertices $x,y$ are connected by an
edge if $x$ and $y$ differ in exactly one coordinate.
Define the $\nth{k}$ layer to be
$L_k := \{ x \in \{0,1\}^n \ | \ |x|_1 = k\}$, where $|x|_1$ denotes the number of $1$s
in $x$. Note that the subgraph induced by layer $k$ and layer $k+1$ is a bipartite
graph $H_n [ L_k \cup L_{k+1}]$. See the picture below for an illustration ($n=3, k=1$):
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/hamming-cube-layer-graph.pdf}
\end{center}
\begin{exercise}
 Let $0 \leq k < n/2$.
 Show that the bipartite graph $H_n [L_k \cup L_{k+1}]$ has a matching of size $|L_k| = {n \choose k}$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
Since $|\Gamma(L_k)| = \binom{n}{k+1} \ge |L_k|$, $\delta(L_k) \le 0$. According to Hall's Therorem, we can find matchings satisfying $M(A) = |L_k| - \delta(A)$. Then $H_n$ has a matching of size $\binom{n}{k}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}
 Let $G = (V,E)$ be a bipartite graph with left side $L$ and right side $R$.
 Suppose $G$ is $d$-regular (every vertex has degree $d$), so in particular $|L| = |R|$.
 Show that $G$
 has a perfect matching (that is, a matching $M$ of size $|L|$).
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
Since $G$ is $d$-regular, we have $|\Gamma(L)| = |R|$ as each vertex is connected to ones in $L$. As we already know $|R| = |L|$, according to Hall's Therorem, we can find a matching with size $|L| - \delta(L) = |L|$, which is a perfect matching.
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}
  Let $G$ a $d$-regular bipartite graph. Show that the edges $E(G)$ can be partitioned
  into $d$ perfect matchings. That is, there are matchings $M_1, \dots, M_d \subseteq E(G)$ such that
  (1) $M_i \cap M_j = \emptyset$ for $1 \leq i < j \leq d$ and
  (2) $M_1 \cup M_2 \cup \dots \cup M_d = E(G)$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
We can prove it by induction.\\
\textbf{Base case}:When $d=1$, we can easily find a perfect matching satisfying two conditions.\\
\textbf{Induction step}:Assume any $k$-regular bipartite graph $G$ can be partitoned into $k$ perfect matchings. Those matchings are denoted as $M_1, \dots, M_k \subseteq E(G)$. Then we increase the degree of each vertex by 1 by adding $|L|$ edges between $L$ and $R$. We get a new $k+1$-regular bipartite graph $G^{'}$ \\
The newly added edges consist a perfect maching denoted as $M_{k+1}$. Obviously, $M_i \cap M_j = \emptyset$ for $1 \leq i < j \leq k+1$ and $M_1 \cup M_2 \cup \dots \cup M_{k+1}= E(G^{'})$\\
Since we can construct and $k+1$-regular bipartite graph from $k$-regular bipartite graph, we can always show that $E(G)$ can be partitionedinto $d$ perfect matchings content with the conditions.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Networks with Vertex Capacities}

Suppose we have a directed graph $G = (V,E)$ but instead of
{\em edge capacities} we have {\em vertex capacities} $c: V \rightarrow \R$.
Now a flow $f$ should observe the {\em vertex capacity constraints}, i.e.,
the outflow from a vertex $u$ should not exceed $c(u)$:
\begin{align*}
  \forall u \in V: \sum_{v \in V, f(u,v) > 0} f(u,v) \leq c(u) \ .
\end{align*}

\begin{exercise} Consider networks with vertex capacities.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Show how to model networks with vertex capacities by
      networks with edge capacities. More precisely,
      show how to transform $G = (V,E,c)$ with $c: V \rightarrow \R^+$
      into a network $G' = (V',E',c')$ with $c': E' \rightarrow \R^+$
      such that every $s$-$t$-flow $f$ in $G$ that respects the vertex capacities
      corresponds to an $s$-$t$-flow $f'$ (of same value) in $G'$ that
      respects edge capacities, and vice versa.

    \begin{solution}
      For any vertex $v$ in $G$, we replace it with two vertexs $v_in$ and $v_out$ and edge $(v_in,v_out)$ with capacity equal to $c(v)$.\\
      Then for any edge $(u,v)$ in $G$, we replace it with $(u,v_in)$ and for any edge $(v,u)$ in $G$, we replace it with $(v_out,u)$. Those edges have unlimited capacity.
    \end{solution}

    \item Draw a picture illustrating your solution.
    \begin{solution}
      \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/11.png}
      \end{center}
    \end{solution}
    \item Show that there is a polynomial time algorithm solving the
      following problem: Given a directed graph $G = (V,E)$ and two
      vertices $s,t \in V$.  Are there $k$ paths $p_1,\dots,p_k$, each
      from $s$ to $t$, such that the paths are {\em internally vertex
        disjoint}?  Here, internally vertex disjoint means that for $i
      \ne j$ the paths $p_i,p_j$ share no vertices besides $s$ and
      $t$.

    \begin{proof}
      Let each vertex capacity be one. Then there are $k$ internally vertex disjoint paths if and only if there is a flow with size $k$.\\
      Since we can transform a model with vertex capacity to a network with edge capacity, we can use Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to find the maximum flow in polynomial time. Then we can solve this problem in polynomial time.
    \end{proof}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  Let $H_n$ be the $n$-dimensional Hamming cube. For $i < n/2$ consider
  $L_i$ and $L_{n-i}$. Note that
  $|L_i| = {n \choose i} = { n \choose n-i}  = L_{n-i}$, so the
  $L_i$ and $L_{n-i}$ have the same size.   Show that there are ${n \choose i}$ paths $p_1,p_2,\dots,p_{ {n \choose i}}$
  in $H_n$ such that
  (i) each path $p$ starts in $L_i$ and ends in $L_{n-i}$;
  (ii) two different paths $p,p'$ do not share any vertices.
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let each vertex capacity be one.
\item Add source vertex and target vertex with unlimited capacity, connect source vertex to all vertexs in $L_i$ and all vertexs in $L_{n-i}$ to target vertex.
\item Transform the vertex capacity network to edge capacity network according to above method. Asd the minimum cut is $\binom{n}{i}$, we are supposed to find $\binom{n}{i}$ disjoint paths through Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm, which means there are $\binom{n}{i}$ paths content with the two conditions.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\subsection{Always, Sometimes, or Never Full}


Let $(G,s,t,c)$ be a flow network, $G = (V,E)$. A directed edge $e=(u,v)$ is called always full if $f(e) = c(e)$ for every maximum flow; it is called sometimes full if $f(e) = c(e)$ for some but not all maximum flows; it is called never full if $f(e) < c(e)$ for all maximum flows.

Let $(S, V\setminus S)$ be a cut. That is, $s \in S, t \in V \setminus S$. We say the edge $e = (u,v)$ is crossing the cut if $u \in S$ and $v \in V \setminus S$. We say $e$ is always crossing if it crosses every minimum cut; sometimes crossing if it crosses some, but not all minimum cuts; never crossing if it crosses no minimum cut. For example, look at this flow network:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/flow-network-always-sometimes-never.pdf}\\
\small Example network: the edges $e,g$ are sometimes full and never crossing; $f$ is never full and never crossing; $h$ is always full and always crossing.
\end{center}

\begin{exercise}
Consider this network:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figures/other-flow-network-always-sometimes-never.pdf}\\
\small The fat edge $a$ has capcity $2$, all other edges have capacity $1$.
\end{center}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Indicate which edges are (i) always full, (ii) sometimes full, (iii) never full.
\item Indicate which edges are (i) always crossing, (ii) sometimes crossing, (iii) never crossing.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
\textbf{solution}\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item Always full:$e$; Sometimes full:$b,c,d,f,g,h,i$; Never full:$a$.
\item Always crossing:$e$; Sometiems crossing:None; Never crossing:$a,b,c,d,f,g,h,i$.
\end{enumerate}


\begin{exercise}
An edge $e$ can be ($x$) always full, ($y$) sometimes full, ($z$) never full; it can be ($x$') always crossing, ($y'$) sometimes crossing, ($z'$) never crossing. So there are nine possible combinations: ($xx'$) always full and always crossing, ($xy'$) always full and sometimes crossing, and so on. Or are there? Maybe some possibilities are impossible.
Let's draw a table:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/11-1.png} \\
\end{center}
The two very simple flow networks in the table already show that $(xx')$ and $(yy')$ are possible; that is,
it is possible to be always full and always crossing, and it is possible to be always full and sometimes crossing.
Fill out the table! That is, for each of the remaining seven cases, find out whether it is possible or not. If it is
possible, draw a (simple) network showing that it is possible; if impossible, give a proof of this fact.
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
$(zx^{'})$ and $(zy^{'})$ are impossible since the maximum flow cross the edge, it must be full according to the definition.\\
$(yx^{'})$ and $(yy^{'})$ are impossible. If a network can have various minimum cut, in the maximum flow, all edges in these minimum cut should be full.\\
$(xz^{'})$ is impossilbe. Since the minimum cut equals to the maximum flow, any edge which is always full can be a part of some minimum cut.\\
\end{solution}
\end{document}
